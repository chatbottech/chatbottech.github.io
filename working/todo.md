   - And now that you’ve read this far, here’s how to submit your
     story to the freeCodeCamp publication: send an email to submit at
     freecodecamp org. Include the URL for your story on Medium
     (preferably an unpublished draft) and the word “bananas” so that
     we’ll know that you have read all this. Only send one story URL
     per email. There’s no need to add anything further to your
     email — we just read the stories and judge them based on their
     own merits.
