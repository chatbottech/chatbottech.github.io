Parlo is a chatbot tool aimed squarely at the enterprise space. It has
a flashy, enterprise-y landing page, so it must be good for big companies:

It also has a big company name behind it, having just been acquired by
[ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/).

Marketing copy
--------------

The people who wrote the marketing copy seem to know what they're
talking about. They talk about grammar engineering, machine learning
(of course) and semantic parsing. This last one is a surprise for me
to see, since this is a technology that I'm
[particularly interested in](https://hackernoon.com/three-ai-technologies-that-could-make-chatbots-intelligent-10f8c6e8b4b0),
and haven't seen applied to chatbots.

Are they really using semantic parsing? It's hard to tell, since I
need to prove I'm from BigCo Limited in order to be able to try it
out. I've requested a demo, so we'll see how we go.

All I've got to go on is this
-----------------------------

In the meantime, the best I have to go on is this YouTube video:

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 my-5">
<iframe class="embed-responsive-item"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5x-mDLrjk0" frameborder="0"
allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


If you can't be bothered to watch it (you're not missing much),
basically, it's like pretty much any other bot creator. You tell your
bot what to say, and add some pretty pictures and buttons.

You also get a tree view:

What next?
----------

Is that really it? I hope not. I'm afraid Parlo won't get a higher
score until I get some proof that it's more capable than the video
above indicates.

I don't know how much Parlo costs, but I'm guessing it ain't cheap. If
you want an alternative, there are popular chatbot builders like
[Chatfuel](/reviews/chatfuel.md) and in fact a
[whole host of other options](/non-technical.md).
