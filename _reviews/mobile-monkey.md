Chatbots for marketers
---------------------

MobileMonkey is aimed squarely at non-technical users - its tagline is
"Chatbots for Marketers - no coding required!" Despite this, it has
some features that put it before other similar tools in terms of being
able to build sophisticated behaviour.

An example of this is the ability to store the user's response to a
question in a variable. This can then be reused at any later point in
your bot's replies.

Monkey features
---------------

MobileMonkey is not really different to any other chatbot building
tool in terms of the features it provides. The difference is in how it
positions itself. It is aimed squarely at marketers, specifically,
those using Facebook Messenger.

This means that the features that are emphasised in the promotional
material are those features likely to appeal to marketers. They have a
feature called "[Chat Blast](https://mobilemonkey.com/chatbots/facebook-messenger-chat-blaster)",
which is just the ability to send messages to multiple users. This
could be all your users, or a particular segment.

This feature is undoubtedly valuable to marketers. It is worth
bearing in mind, however, that other tools also have this feature. For
example, [Chatfuel](/reviews/chatfuel.html) has a similar feature they
call
"[broadcasting](https://docs.chatfuel.com/broadcasting/broadcasting-documentation/broadcasting)".

Similarly, MobileMonkey's [live chat](https://mobilemonkey.com/chatbots/live-operator-chat-takeover/)
feature is similar to Chatfuel's, available via a
[plugin](https://docs.chatfuel.com/plugins/plugin-documentation/live-chat).

Flow monkeys
------------

What about actually building a bot? The user experience is defined in
terms of "pages" - collections of messages sent by the bot to
user. These are typically followed by a collection of quick response
buttons which send the user to a different page. The user is thus
exploring a network (or graph) of pages with buttons providing the
connections between the nodes in the network. Whilst it may be
cumbersome to build the interface in this manner, it does allow for
some fairly sophisticated flows to be designed, if you're willing to
put in the time to think through all the different routes and
possibilities.

Monkey pricing
--------------

MobileMonkey has the following pricing structure:
 - Free for unlimited contacts but limited features. This is actually
   a very generous free tier as it does not require using the
   MobileMarketing branding, unlike other tools free tiers.
 - $49 a month: includes scheduled blasts, drip campaigns and bot
   analytics. It is likely that if you are serious about using bots
   for marketing you are going to want to use some of these
   features. Limited to 5,000 contacts.
 - $149 a month: agency dashboard, unlimited live bots and Facebook
   pages, and premier support. Limited to 5,000 contacts. I suspect
   this offer is just here to make the $49 a month one look more
   attractive. I can't see an obvious reason why most people would
   need this option.

Additional contacts are available from $24 a month, and you can save
15% by signing up for a whole year.

Monkey positioning
------------------

In summary, MobileMonkey is easy to use and reasonably priced, with
features tailored to Facebook marketing.

You won't build a very intelligent bot with MobileMonkey, but if
you're interested in marketing, you probably don't need one. You just
need to send messages to users in an intelligent way, and MobileMonkey
provides you with tools to do that.

Since MobileMonkey distinguishes itself by targeting marketers, it is
worth considering how much you value this. It does mean that the
supporting documentation and promotional material will quickly point
you at the features you need and how they will benefit you. It may
also mean that you get more support tailored towards marketing.

The generous free tier means that it is probably worth trying out if
you're looking for a bot to help with Facebook marketing.

What next?
----------

MobileMonkey's closest competitor is
[ManyChat](https://manychat.com/), which is also aimed at
marketers. It has a similar feature set, but we thought it was
slightly easier to use and better value. Check out the
