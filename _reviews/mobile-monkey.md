MobileMonkey is aimed squarely at non-technical users - its tagline
is "Chatbots for Marketers - no coding required!" Despite this, it has
some features that put it before other similar tools in terms of being
able to build sophisticated behaviour.

An example of this is the ability to store the user's response to a
question in a variable. This can then be reused at any later point in
your bot's replies.

The user experience is defined in terms of "pages" - collections of
messages sent by the bot to user. These are typically followed by a
collection of quick response buttons which send the user to a
different page. The user is thus exploring a network (or graph) of pages with
buttons providing the connections between the nodes in the
network. Whilst it may be cumbersome to build the interface in this
manner, it does allow for some fairly sophisticated flows to be
designed, if you're willing to put in the time to think through all
the different routes and possibilities.

MobileMonkey has the following pricing structure:
 - Free for up to 100 contacts and one bot
 - $49 a month for up to 1.000 contacts and one bot
 - $149 a month for up to 2,000 contacts and unlimited bots

Additional contacts are charged at $20 a month per 1,000 contacts.

In summary, MobileMonkey is easy to use and reasonably priced, with
some useful features, but ultimately it's mediocre.
