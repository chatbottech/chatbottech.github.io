Another day, another chatbot builder to destroy.

<img src="/img/recast-ai-screenshot.png" class="img-fluid">

The thing is, they hit a sore nerve on their landing page. It claims,
"No more dumb bots - easily create bots that truly understand humans."

Truly understand. _Truly_ understand. Truly _understand_. That's quite
a claim.

Let's leave aside for a minute the question of whether computers are
actually capable of understanding. We'll be generous in our
interpretation. What they mean is, you can easily build a bot that
will be able to respond to any user query. That response will seem
intelligent.

Ok, let's test that claim. Unfortunately for Recast.AI, they've done
what I wish every chatbot tool website would do, and doesn't. They've
put links to bots made with their tool _on their landing
page_. Prominantly. These had better be good.

Now we'll see, how good is your tool?

I think you can see where this is going. It's not good.

The first link is to "La Bringue" that seems to have been renamed
[Goosebump](https://www.messenger.com/t/higoosebump?ref=recast-home). Ok
Goosebump, do you _truly_ understand?

GB: Hello Daoud, I help you find the best events ðŸ™Œ Where are you?

Me: luton

GB: First things first, tell me where you are...

Me: I'm in luton

GB: Sorry... I don't know about the parties in Luton yet but I hear
they're killer. I'll work on it I promise ðŸ˜˜

GB: What city are you in?

Me: london

GB: First things first, tell me where you are...

Me: I'm in london

GB: First things first, tell me where you are...

Me: _clicks some buttons, navigates a GUI..._

GB: London mode activatedðŸ‘Œ

GB: Now, write your request or click on one of the following options:

Me: _clicks on "This weekend"_

GB: Boom! The best parties for this weekend:

GB: _presents a carousel of parties that admittedly look like
they might be interesting, if I were into parties._

I'm sorry, Goosebump. You don't truly understand.

Never mind. Because actually, Recast AI is rather good. It provides
semantic parsing capabilities, much like Dialogflow. And it actually
works.

The nicest thing is the set of community contributed intents, together
with expressions which allow you to quickly get your bot going, if
there happens to be intents which relate to your bot's desired
capabilities.

Recast AI also boasts an impressive list of no less than fourteen
different deployment channels. If you need a bot for Twitch, Twilio
and Twitter, look no further.

Recast AI's website is cagey when it comes to pricing. It is free for
for individuals, with an (apparently unenforced) limit of three
requests per second. For companies they offer "bespoke solutions" at
unspecified cost.

In summary, this tool seems to be good. Just ignore what other people
make with it, and make something better.
