Talkbot at first glance seems like yet another boring bot
creator. Unfortunately, it also seems like that on subsequent glances.

It is, however, unarguably easy to use. I made a bot and had a
conversation with it in under five minutes:

It is also still in beta, so it's a bit unfair of me to be mean about
it. Nevertheless, I can't help wishing that its creators had been a
bit more creative.

The usual stuff
---------------

It has the usual features:
 - a layout to design your conversation flow (I'm really starting to
hate these)
 - triggers based off things like word or phrase detection, or a
specific delay.
 - defining a persistent menu (I also hate the idea that something
   you're meant to chat to should have a menu)
 - ability to add cute cat pictures, etc.
 
I just find it hard to get excited about this stuff any more. It's
like someones said, "All the other chatbot creators are doing this.  I
can do exactly the same, and therefore I should." I'm afraid this
logic doesn't appeal to me.

API
---

Interestingly, it also has the ability to communicate with your own
servers via an API. You can trigger a request to your server, and
accept POST requests from your server to communicate back with users.

More?
-----

There's probably more, but I have to say, by this point, I'm not
terribly enthused. If you want a chatbot builder with this set of
features, you're probably better off with something that's not in
beta. [Chatfuel](/reviews/chatfuel.html) would be an obvious choice,
but if that's not your cup of tea, there are
[plenty more to choose from](/non-technical.html).
