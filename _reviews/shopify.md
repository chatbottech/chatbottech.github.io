A Review of Shopify for Messenger
=================================

If you use Shopify, it is as easy as it could possibly be to add their
Messenger bot offering. Just click "+" beside "Sales Channels" and add
Messenger. You may be disappointed with the actual behaviour
however. The bot only responds to users' actions on "quick response"
buttons - it seems that if they try to enter any other query, it is
just ignored. A user is expected to make use of the default menu to
interact with the bot.

Once you've added the Messenger sales channel, there are some
customisations you can make - you can change the default message and
the name of the various menu items, for example. These customisation
options are extremely limited, however, and there is little scope for
changing the behaviour of your bot.
