A Review of Octane AI Messenger Marketing Platform
==================================================

Octane AI is a Shopify plugin and Facebook Messenger bot whose main
selling point is its promise to reduce shopping cart
abandonment. Whilst chatbots are used to do this, most of the benefit
comes from a small change to the Shopify user interface, namely a
small checkbox added next to the "Add to Cart" button. Anyone who
presses the button while logged into Facebook, and while the checkbox
is ticked will have their Messenger contact details sent to the shop
owner, allowing them to contact them at any future point in time.

It is easy to see why this is valuable. The shop owner will
automatically have contact details for the majority of users who do
not untick the box before clicking the button. Octane AI then sends
messages to users who fail to make a purchase after adding something
to their cart, reminding them to complete their purchase.

There is one snag in this process for new users of Octane
AI. Immediately after signing up, the checkbox will remain unticked by
default. This will have a big impact on its effectiveness, since users
are unlikely to tick the box of their own accord. Octane AI has to
request Facebook to whitelist your store (which they do after you sign
up) so that the box can be ticked by default. This can take 1-2 weeks,
so you'll just have to be patient (and use up your free trial) in the
mean time.

In addition to this main selling point, Octane AI also provides some
fairly standard features for non-technical users to create
chatbots. This includes "convos", or guided conversations, "drips" -
messages sent at specific time intervals, and "smart responses",
manually specified responses to user inputs.

Of these, the "convos" are the most interesting. You can specify quick
response buttons for user input, and each can trigger a tangent in the
conversation, allowing for a tree of possibilities to be
specified. The design process suffers from the same problems as many
competitors - when something is wrong or missing you cannot save the
convo, and it is not always clear what you have to do.

Octane AI is one of those annoying products that hides its pricing
until it's too late and you've already signed up. It costs $99 a month
but includes a 14 day free trial. Billing works seamlessly through
Shopify - Octane AI is a "Shopify App", although not listed in the
Shopify App Store.

Really what you are paying for is the magic checkbox - all the other
features are provided more cheaply by competitors. And that is
something that is almost certainly worth paying for.
