A Review of ManyChat Chatbot Creator
=====================================

I like Manychat because it is easy to use, it focuses on doing one
thing and doing it well. It is targeted at marketers and only works
with the Facebook Messenger platform. This makes sense because in my
opinion there is a huge opportunity for Messenger marketing.

The basic setup can literally be done in five minutes. And for many
marketing applications it's not a bad start. Admittedly all you get is
a welcome message and the ability to broadcast messages to people. But
for marketing purposes, you don't need much else.

Actually there is more for those who need it. You can specify a
default reply, the standard one provided allows users to say they want
to talk to a human. If the user clicks this, you get a notification
and can respond directly. This is a very useful feature.

You can also match keywords in the user's query. You can trigger
actions to be taken on these keywords, such as adding a tag to the
user, subscribing the user to a sequence, or notifying an admin user
(only available in the Pro option). You can specify a reply to be sent
to the user, which can include text, an image, card, gallery, list,
audio, video or file.

There is a "Basic Builder" for simple bot interactions, and a "Flow
Builder" to allow a complex flow of interactions to be constructed. As
with Chatfuel, you can specify buttons and define actions to be taken
when the user presses a button, such as sending a message, or
triggering the start of another "flow".

The fact that the platform is restricted to Messenger means that bots
built with this tool will make appropriate use of Messenger features,
in particular the Messenger "quick reply" buttons. As with Chatfuel,
this is a big benefit: users engage much more with a bot when they
don't have to type.

As with any of these flow-based bot builders, you will not build a
super-intelligent bot - but you may well build a useable one.

Pricing is on a sliding scale depending on the number of "subscribers"
to your bot:

 - 500 subscribers for $10 a month
 - 1,000 subscribers for $15 a month
 - 5,000 subscribers for $45 a month
 - 10,000 subscribers for $65 a month

There is also a free option that displays "Powered by ManyChat" in the
bot's persistent menu. You probably don't want that if you're using
this professionally.
