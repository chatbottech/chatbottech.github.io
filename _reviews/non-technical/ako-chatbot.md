A Review of Ako Chatbot for Shopify
===================================

Ako is one a of a few chatbot platforms that specifically target
Shopify. There is a lot of potential for chatbots to improve the user
experience in e-commerce. Unfortunately, neither Ako nor any of its current
competitors seem to be making headway in fulfilling that
potential. The behaviour of their bots is trivial, to say the best.

The main purported benefit of using Ako is that you can specify
answers to frequently asked questions which bot users can access. In
practice, all you can really do is set up a bunch of menu options and
standard responses. A conversational interface it is not.

Ako has a free "Starter Plan" which doesn't seem to do anything, so
you'll need to fork out $12 a month if you want some actual features.
