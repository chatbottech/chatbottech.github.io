A Review of Octane AI Messenger Marketing Platform
==================================================

Octane AI is a Shopify plugin and Facebook Messenger bot whose main
selling point is its promise to reduce shopping cart
abandonment. Whilst chatbots are used to do this, most of the benefit
comes from a small change to the Shopify user interface, namely a
small checkbox added next to the "Add to Cart" button. Anyone who
presses the button while logged into Facebook, and while the checkbox
is ticked will have their Messenger contact details sent to the shop
owner, allowing them to contact them at any future point in time.

It is easy to see why this is valuable. The shop owner will
automatically have contact details for the majority of users who do
not untick the box before clicking the button. Octane AI then sends
messages to users who fail to make a purchase after adding something
to their cart, reminding them to complete their purchase.

There is one snag in this process for new users of Octane
AI. Immediately after signing up, the checkbox will remain unticked by
default. This will have a big impact on its effectiveness, since users
are unlikely to tick the box of their own accord. Octane AI has to
request Facebook to whitelist your store (which they do after you sign
up) so that the box can be ticked by default. This can take 1-2 weeks,
so you'll just have to be patient in the mean time.
