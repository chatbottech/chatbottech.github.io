A Review of Motion AI Chatbot Creator
=====================================

Motion AI, rather like Flow XO, is basically a graphical user
interface for programming, with a few tools that are useful for some
of the superficial problems encountered in building a bot. It's core
contribution seems to be "modules" - tools for extracting particular
types of information from messages, for example phone numbers or email
addresses, or allow the user to choose from a limited set of
choices. Whilst these are arguably essential for a comprehensive
bot-building system, there are several things wrong with this:

 - This type of functionality should be built-in, rather than being
   elevated to the level of "modules".
 - I need to know before-hand whether the user is likely to enter a
   phone number or email address - other systems will detect them in
   the users input regardless of context.
 - Speaking of other systems, Facebook Messenger can now has built in
   natural language processing that can detect this type of input, and
   include it in the information relayed to the bot.

Once modules have been defined, the flow between them is defined by
creating "connections", which define the conditions necessary to move
from one module to the next. Again, this is simply a cumbersome method
of programming, and does not aid the bot designer in actually making
an intelligent bot.

It also has some basic functionality for randomizing responses,
incorporating the user's feedback into the response, as well as
allowing the embedding of images, audio and video.

Pricing doesn't seem to be mentioned on the website, perhaps because
they've just been purchased by Hubspot (a bit of a waste of money in
my opinion). Apparently there is a generous free tier, but no
specification of what it is.

In summary, this is a platform that doesn't provide any significant
functionality for building an intelligent bot, without any pricing
information.
