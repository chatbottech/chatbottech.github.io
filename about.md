About chatbottech
=================

There are a bewildering array of chatbot tools, and new ones are being
created all the time. I created this site to help you choose the right
one.

I have tried my best to be impartial when reviewing these tools, and I
certainly don't hold back when I see something that could be
improved. I'm not paid by anyone for links to their tool.

About me

Hi, I'm Daoud! I've been excited about conversational interfaces ever
since I watched Star Trek as a kid (although I don't think that term
excited then). I actually used to read books about parsing and grammar
on holiday because I really wanted to understand this stuff. I ended
up doing a PhD in computational linguistics and inventing my own
theory of meaning.

I am currently working on my own chatbot platform. I feel like all the
existing tools are not ambitious enough: they do not enable people to
build bots that are really intelligent. I
[wrote a blog post](http://daoudclarke.github.io/chatbots/2018/02/06/manifesto-for-a-new-chatbot-platform)
about my reasoning for creating a new platform, and how I think it
should be done.

I created this site for several reasons:

 - I thought it would be a good way to find potential customers for my
   own platform
 - I knew that by the time I had created it I would know my
   competition really well
 - I thought it would be a really useful resource for lots of people
