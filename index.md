There are many different types of tools that can be used to create
chatbots and conversational interfaces. It is important to understand
the different categories of tool that are available so that you can
choose the tool that is right for you.

[Choosing the right tool](/choose.html) can make a big difference. If
the tool is too complex or requires technical input, you may struggle
to use it effectively. Conversely, if the tool is designed for
building simple bot prototypes but you want to build something
sophisticated, a simple tool may not be enough.

This site divides tools into two main categories:

- [Non-technical tools](/non-technical.html): these are tools that
  anyone can use to quickly build a chatbot. These can be used to
  create simple chatbots or prototypes to quickly learn whether
  chatbots are a good fit for your application. You will likely not be
  able to handle complex integrations with your website, and your bot
  will not behave intelligently. Nevertheless, these tools are very
  useful even for those that are able to code. An example of a popular
  tool in this category is [Chatfuel](/reviews/chatfuel.html)
- [Developer tools](/developer.html): these are tools that require
  coding to use effectively.
