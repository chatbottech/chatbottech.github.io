There are many different types of tools that can be used to create
chatbots and conversational interfaces. It is important to understand
the different categories of tool that are available so that you can
choose the tool that is right for you.

[Choosing the right tool](/choose.html) can make a big difference. If
the tool is too complex or requires technical input, you may struggle
to use it effectively. Conversely, if the tool is designed for
building simple bot prototypes but you want to build something
sophisticated, a simple tool may not be enough.

<h3 class="text-center m-5">Non-technical vs developer tools</h3>

This site divides tools into two main categories:

- [Non-technical tools](/non-technical.html): these are tools that
  anyone can use to quickly build a chatbot. These can be used to
  create simple chatbots or prototypes to quickly learn whether
  chatbots are a good fit for your application. You will likely not be
  able to handle complex integrations with your website, and your bot
  will not behave intelligently. Nevertheless, these tools are very
  useful even for those that are able to code. An example of a popular
  tool in this category is [Chatfuel](/reviews/chatfuel.html)
- [Developer tools](/developer.html): these are tools that require
  coding to use effectively. An example of this is [Microsoft's Bot
  Framework](/reviews/microsoft-bot-framework.html) which requires
  coding in C# or Node.js. [Facebook's Wit.ai](/reviews/witai.html)
  provides an API which developers can use to help understand user's
  requests.

Some tools fall into both categories, for example [Google's
Dialogflow](/reviews/dialogflow.html) can be used without doing any
development, but provides additional capabilities for those who want
to integrate with their code.

<h3 class="text-center m-5">Tools for marketers</h3>

Within each category there are different types of tool. For example,
both [Mobile Monkey](/reviews/mobile-monkey.html) and
[ManyChat](/reviews/manychat.html) are non-technical tools aimed at
marketers.

There is a lot of potential for using chatbots for marketing. For
example, it is possible to use Facebook advertising to send users
directly to a Messenger chatbot. Users interacting with the chatbot
consent to be contacted by the bot at a later point in time. This
means that the cost-per-acquisition of Messenger contacts can be much
lower than traditional email marketing.

<h3 class="text-center m-5">Chatbots for e-commerce</h3>

If you use Shopify, you can provide users with a chatbot experience
with [their own built-in chatbot](/reviews/shopify.html), or you can
use a third party plugin such as [Octane
AI](/reviews/octane-ai.html). Either way, it makes sense to use a
chatbot platform tailored to e-commerce, and Shopify in particular.
